Hello! I want to build a browser-based PvP card game as a single-page application (SPA) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend with Firebase backend services. No Node.js or server-side code, everything client-side.

The main features:

User authentication with Firebase Auth supporting email/password and Google sign-in. There are two roles: normal users and admins.

After login, users see a main page with tabs:

Ranking: top 10 players by PvP wins (from Firestore)

Rooms: list of all active PvP rooms, users can join any room

Deck: user can build their deck of 10 cards from all available cards (base + admin-created)

Create Room: user creates a PvP or PvE room (PvE is vs bot with a fixed deck)

Cards have two types: Battle Units and Abilities.
Battle Units have health, damage, passive skill (optional), and hidden stats: critical chance (5%) and critical damage (50%) which can be boosted by abilities.
Battle units have classes: melee, ranged, mage, with rock-paper-scissors advantages: melee > mage (+15% damage), mage > ranged, ranged > melee.

Base set of 10 cards are hardcoded but editable by admins; admins can also add, edit, and delete custom cards.

Deck building UI allows drag and drop or clicking to add/remove cards visually. Deck is saved in Firestore under user profile.

PvP rooms synchronize players with Firestore:

When two players join a room, a battle starts.

Both roll dice to decide who goes first.

Each player starts with 20 HP and 100 energy.

Each round players select a battle card and optionally play ability cards using energy.

Players press “Ready” button to submit moves; when both ready, the round resolves: winning card deals 1 damage to enemy HP, losing card goes to pass, cards are cycled in deck.

Energy regenerates +20 on round win, +15 on loss.

Game ends when a player’s HP reaches 0; winner gets +1 win counted in ranking.

Admin panel accessible from admin profile lets admins manage cards and see basic stats.

Technical stack and instructions:

Use Firebase Authentication (email + Google) for login.

Use Firebase Firestore for real-time data: users, decks, cards, rooms, matches, rankings.

Use Firebase SDK loaded via CDN as ES modules in the browser.

Use Tailwind CSS (via CDN) or custom CSS for UI styling.

All code must be frontend only (no Node.js or backend servers).

Use modular, clean JavaScript with async/await.

The app must have a fully visual UI with buttons, lists, drag-and-drop or click interactions, status displays, health bars, energy bars, and card images.

Cards must show their stats visually.

Room list updates live as rooms are created/joined.

Battle UI should show each player’s HP, energy, current cards in hand, played cards, and ready status.

Dependencies to install or link (preferably via CDN):

Firebase app, auth, firestore (latest 10.x versions) as ES modules from https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/
